# Robot-arm

This task controls a robot arm using the Joint State Publisher and through movement and kinematics. The task is implemented using ROS on Ubuntu 20.04 within a virtual machine.

Controlling the robot arm by joint_state_publisher

1- Set up the ROS environment to create a workspace.


2- Clone the robot arm package from the smart method repository.


3- Install all the dependencies.


4-Open the robot arm where you can control it with the joint state publisher.


5- Visualizes the communication between nodes and topics in the ROS.


6- Displays the real-time data being published to the joint states topic.


7- Adjust the position of the joint of the robot arm.

Controlling the robot arm by Moveit and kinematics

8- Launch the gazebo to simulate the robot arms.


9- Change the permissions of the joint_states_to_gazebo.py file to make it executable. 


10- Visualizes the communication between nodes and topics to control the robot arm.


11- Plan the move of the robot arm in Moveit and see the actual move in the gazebo.
